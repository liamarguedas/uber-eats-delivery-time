    "# Uber Earts Food Delivery Time System\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to leverage the power of data science to solve a real-world problem. By using various statistical and machine learning techniques, we will analyze a large dataset to uncover hidden patterns and relationships between variables. Through this analysis, I hope to gain new insights that can inform decision-making and lead to actionable outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will involve several phases, including data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation. I will use various tools and technologies, such as Python, SQL, and visualization libraries to facilitate this process, this phases will be introducted as Machine Learning workflow, goals and will be separated in different notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the purpose of this project is to guide through a typical checklist for an end-to-end data science workflow and demonstrate my thought process while solving a problem, in this case I am going to be working with a real life problem from Uber Technologies Inc.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal with this project it's to implement a prediction model and solve the problem the most efficient way posible, taking into account the cost of deployment and score of the trained model. For this, I am looking a sustainable model and cost efficient for Uber.\n",

    "# Machine Learning Workflow\n",
    "Since I am dealing with a real life problem, I must implement a workflow to keep everything simple and having a clear goal to approach and reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, in my particular case the Machine Learning Workflow will have 7 sections that will be separated in different notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Question or problem definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Acquire training and testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Supply or submit the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to say that having a clear mindset through the entire notebook may implied combining multiple workflow stages, perform a stage earlier than indicated or perfom a stage multiple times in our workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would not change the main goal of the project or the approach we are trying to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Workflow goals\n",
    "As a data scientist I will use every tool available to provide a solution for seven major goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classifying:** I may want to classify or categorize our samples. I may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlating:** The problem need to be solved based on available features within the training dataset, so it is importan to ask: Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a correlation among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Converting:** Depending on the choice of model algorithm I may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Complementing:** Data preparation may also require me to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Correcting:** I may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors (Outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Creating:** I could create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features if I need to, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion and completeness goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Charting:** Select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solutions goals.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Uber Eats is an online food ordering and delivery platform. It is a subsidiary of Uber Technologies, the same company known for its ride-hailing service. Uber Eats allows users to browse menus, place orders, and have food delivered from a wide range of restaurants and food establishments in their area. The Uber Eats platform operates through a mobile application and a website. Users can download the app on their smartphones or access the service through the website. Once logged in, users can enter their delivery address to view a list of participating restaurants nearby.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can browse through various menus, select items they want to order, customize their meals if applicable, and add them to their virtual cart. The app also provides total cost of the order, including taxes, fees, and delivery charges. When the order is placed, it is transmitted to the restaurant. The restaurant then prepares the food and hands it over to an Uber Eats driver for delivery. Uber Eats drivers, often referred to as \"delivery partners,\" use their own vehicles to pick up the food and deliver it to the customer's location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the process, users can track the progress of their order within the app, including when it's being prepared, when the driver is en route, and when it's delivered. Payment for the order is typically done through the app, using a credit card or other payment methods available in the user's account.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "Food Delivery services like Uber need to show the time it will take to deliver the order to keep transparency with their customers.  Showing accurate delivery times is crucial for Uber Eats because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Expectations:** In today's fast-paced world, customers have come to expect convenience and efficiency when it comes to food delivery. Providing accurate delivery time estimates helps manage customer expectations and ensures they are aware of when their order will arrive. It enhances transparency and helps build trust between the platform and the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Satisfaction:** Delivery time accuracy directly impacts customer satisfaction. If a delivery is consistently delayed or arrives much later than anticipated, it can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction. On the other hand, if the estimated delivery time is reliable and the order arrives promptly, it enhances the overall customer experience and increases the likelihood of repeat business.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Management:** Accurate delivery time predictions enable customers to plan their day effectively. By knowing when their order will arrive, they can schedule their activities accordingly, whether it's waiting at home or stepping out briefly. This feature is particularly important for busy individuals who have limited time and need to manage their daily routines efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operational Efficiency:** Reliable delivery time predictions allow delivery platforms to optimize their operations. By accurately estimating delivery times, they can manage their fleet of delivery partners more effectively, assign orders based on distance and estimated delivery time, and streamline the entire delivery process. This can lead to improved efficiency, reduced idle time, and better resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reputation and Competition:** Delivery platforms operate in a highly competitive market, and accurate delivery time predictions contribute to their overall reputation. When customers consistently receive their orders within the estimated time frame, it enhances the platform's reliability and positive word-of-mouth, which can attract new customers and retain existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Retention:** Timely delivery is crucial for customer retention. When customers have a positive experience with on-time deliveries, they are more likely to continue using the service and recommend it to others. On the other hand, frequent delays or unreliable delivery times can drive customers away, leading to a loss of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, accurate delivery time predictions are vital for services like Uber Eats to manage customer expectations, enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, build a positive reputation, and ultimately retain and attract customers. By leveraging data science and advanced analytics, these platforms can improve their prediction capabilities, leading to a more reliable and enjoyable food delivery experience for customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately predict food delivery times in real-time, several factors need to be taken into account. One crucial aspect is calculating the distance between the food preparation point (usually a restaurant) and the point of food consumption (the delivery location). By determining the geographical separation, we gain a fundamental parameter for estimating the delivery duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to distance, it is essential to consider historical data on delivery times for similar distances. This information allows us to identify and establish relationships between the time taken by delivery partners in the past and the corresponding delivery distances. Analyzing this data enables us to uncover patterns, trends, and dependencies that can help us make accurate predictions about future delivery durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques, we can build a predictive model that takes into account not only the distance but also various other factors that can impact delivery times. These factors may include traffic conditions, time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, and even the current workload of delivery partners. By incorporating these variables into our model, we can create a more comprehensive and accurate estimation of the food delivery time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the model can be continuously improved and updated as new data becomes available. By regularly updating the model with the latest delivery data, we can ensure that it remains relevant and reflective of changing conditions and trends in the delivery process.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that real-time delivery time prediction requires a dynamic and responsive system. As new orders come in and delivery partners are assigned, the model needs to recalculate and adjust the estimated delivery times based on the current circumstances. This ensures that customers receive up-to-date and reliable information about when they can expect their food to arrive."
